# Ambit User Manual

This manual is for people using Ambit public beta builds. It explains how to install Ambit, add image folders, browse and search a library, inspect metadata, organize images, and recover from common library problems.

Ambit is currently a public beta. Official public beta builds are Windows-only while macOS and Linux support is being validated.

## How Ambit Works

Ambit catalogs local image folders. It does not need to move your original image files into a managed library folder.

    B --> C["Local SQLite catalog"]
    B --> D["Generated thumbnails"]
    C --> E["Browse, search, filter"]
    C --> F["Collections and maintenance"]
    C --> G["Viewer and metadata"]
```

The core app is local-first. Image records, metadata, thumbnails, and settings are stored on your machine. Optional network features are documented in [Settings And Privacy](settings-and-privacy.md).
