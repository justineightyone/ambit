# InvokeAI Image Assets and Metadata Roadmap

Status: Complete (`2026-07-22`, 8 of 8 work packages accepted)

## Reconciliation

- This is a standalone InvokeAI feature workstream, not a numbered milestone.
- Existing numbered milestones, including the ComfyUI-specific Milestone 23,
  are unchanged and do not gate this work.
- SQLite remains the source of truth for Ambit image records. InvokeAI source
  facts are stored separately from parsed generation metadata so user edits and
  parser upgrades cannot erase them.
- InvokeAI `image_category` is authoritative for known image-asset detection:
  `general` is a gallery/output image; `user`, `control`, `mask`, and `other`
  are InvokeAI image assets. Missing or unknown categories remain visible and
  unclassified.
- `image_origin` is supplementary provenance, and `is_intermediate` is an
  independent visibility dimension.
- The product remains local-first. No cloud data flow is introduced.

## Objective

Make InvokeAI image assets detectable and hidden by default without losing
them, improve high-value metadata parity, expose reference provenance, and add
explicit multi-user database scoping.

The roadmap is staged so each stage is independently useful:

1. source classification, default asset visibility, sync reconciliation, and
   high-value metadata parity;
2. reference-image provenance and navigation;
3. InvokeAI multi-user ownership and isolation.

## Locked Product Decisions

- Known InvokeAI image assets are hidden from ordinary browsing by default.
- A persisted View toggle reveals them; cards show stable, top-centered
  `Asset · User`, `Asset · Control`, `Asset · Mask`, or `Asset · Other`
  markers. Asset viewers lead with source and reference provenance, while
  ordinary generation viewers keep that provenance near Raw Metadata. There
  is no dedicated asset page or subtype filter in this workstream.
- Existing records receive a one-time automatic classification reconciliation.
- Known assets are excluded from Untagged maintenance, but remain eligible for
  missing-file, duplicate, thumbnail, and Removed workflows.
- Reference provenance supports both forward links and backlinks.
- In a multi-user InvokeAI database, Ambit auto-selects the sole owner, blocks
  import when multiple owners exist until one is chosen, and offers an explicit
  warned All users mode.
- Rows outside the chosen owner scope remain stored but hidden and recoverable;
  they are not deleted. Orphan recovery is disabled in owner mode.

## Work Package 1: Source Contract and Database Persistence

Status: Complete (`codex/invokeai-image-assets`, `2026-07-18`)

Evidence:

- migration 63 adds nullable InvokeAI image name/category/origin columns to
  active and Removed records;
- the generated classifier maps `general` to output, maps
  `user`/`control`/`mask`/`other` to asset, and leaves unknown or missing values
  unclassified;
- the default-visible fast-sort query uses the new index in SQLite's
  query plan;
- native batch upserts accept authoritative source snapshots, including a
  nullable category/origin, while preserving source facts during generic
  metadata rescans;
- source facts survive path-identity repair and the TypeScript Removed
  lifecycle;
- 64 focused repository tests, 11 image-command tests, 4 migration registry
  tests, and 3 migration-63 tests pass;
- the release-gate version, binding, lint, type, build-size, coverage, Rust-test,
  and Tauri production-build checks pass; the Rust steps used an isolated Cargo
  target because an unrelated process held the default target lock;
- Rust formatting and diff checks pass.

Primary invariant: InvokeAI source classification survives save, update,
removal, restoration, and path-identity repair independently of generation
metadata.

Scope:

- Add optional InvokeAI image name, category, and origin fields to the image
  domain and native persistence contract.
- Add the source columns to active and removed image records.
- Add an indexed generated known-asset classification and a compatible
  large-library sort index.
- Carry the fields through lightweight/full row mapping and Removed lifecycle
  operations.
- Regenerate Specta TypeScript bindings from Rust.

Non-goals:

- No InvokeAI source database query changes or automatic backfill yet.
- No gallery toggle, badges, viewer UI, parser changes, references, or owner
  selection.

Targeted verification:

- migration classification and schema tests;
- native batch upsert tests;
- TypeScript row-mapping and Removed lifecycle tests;
- binding drift check, typecheck, Rust formatting, and diff checks.

Completion criteria:

- the source fields round-trip through active and removed records;
- known categories classify deterministically while unknown/missing categories
  remain unclassified;
- generation metadata changes cannot alter source classification;
- focused checks pass and the package is independently review-clean.

## Work Package 2: InvokeAI Sync and One-Time Reconciliation

Depends on: Work Package 1.

Status: Complete (`codex/invokeai-image-assets`, `2026-07-18`)

Evidence:

- normal InvokeAI imports now persist source image name, category, and origin;
  schemas without category/origin explicitly clear those optional source facts,
  and null generation metadata remains a valid import case;
- a collision-safe two-pass reconciliation resolves canonical image paths and
  only emits a legacy flat-path alias when it belongs to one unambiguous source
  row, its canonical file exists, and the legacy path does not; it scans every
  InvokeAI image row independently of timestamps and the intermediate import
  preference;
- the native reconciliation command updates active and Removed source columns
  atomically without touching metadata, notes, favorite/pin, board, removal,
  or generated-classifier state directly;
- import-schema version 1 makes unchanged legacy snapshots reconcile once on
  startup or manual sync, persists only after the complete sync succeeds, and
  retries after cancellation or failure; Live Watch never starts the broad
  pass;
- the Settings/manual rescan route now uses the same managed Sync context as
  startup and Live Watch, and the Invoke sync service is loaded as a separate
  production chunk;
- 8 source-reconciliation tests, 35 Invoke sync-service tests, 47 Sync-context
  integration tests, the generated-command contract, snapshot tests, and App
  orchestration tests pass;
- the complete release gate passes: 2,795 frontend tests (one skipped), 485
  Rust tests, generated-binding drift, lint, typecheck, coverage, build guard,
  and the no-bundle Tauri release build; the guarded initial bundle is 431 kB
  with a separate 25.16 kB Invoke sync chunk and no ineffective dynamic import.

Primary invariant: InvokeAI database facts are reconciled without overwriting
Ambit user edits or importing newly excluded intermediates.

Scope:

- Select `image_category`, `image_origin`, and source `image_name` when present.
- Treat null generation metadata as a normal import case rather than an
  intermediate heuristic.
- Keep `is_intermediate` orthogonal to image-asset classification.
- Add an import-schema version to the InvokeAI snapshot state.
- On version mismatch, reconcile source classification across all matching
  existing InvokeAI rows, including already stored intermediates, while normal
  new-image imports continue to respect import settings.
- Mark the version current only after a successful reconciliation.

Non-goals:

- No asset UI or reference extraction.
- No destructive cleanup of legacy rows.

Targeted verification:

- category/origin compatibility matrix;
- missing metadata and unknown category cases;
- cancelled/failed reconciliation retry behavior;
- preservation of edited metadata, notes, favorite/pin, and board state.

Completion criteria:

- existing and new InvokeAI records receive correct source facts;
- legacy classifications backfill once and retry safely after interruption;
- excluded intermediates are not newly imported by reconciliation.

## Work Package 3: Gallery Visibility and Source Labels

Depends on: Work Packages 1 and 2.

Status: Complete (`codex/invokeai-image-assets`, `2026-07-18`)

Evidence:

- known `user`, `control`, `mask`, and `other` InvokeAI image assets are hidden
  by default across normal result queries, while missing and unknown categories
  remain visible;
- a persisted View control reveals image assets without changing collection
  sidebar counts or cached/custom collection thumbnails;
- revealed cards show known category badges, and the viewer presents every
  available InvokeAI source fact independently of generation metadata;
- known assets are excluded only from Untagged maintenance; direct viewer access
  and missing-file, duplicate, thumbnail, and Removed workflows remain intact;
- 385 focused tests across 16 frontend files pass, including store/settings
  persistence, SQL scopes, browser mocks, maintenance behavior, cards, viewer
  source labels, and a 10,000-item virtual-grid bound;
- the migration-63 query-plan regression confirms SQLite uses
  `idx_images_invoke_asset_fast_sort_v1` for the default asset-hidden sort;
- the complete release gate passes: version and generated-binding checks, lint,
  typecheck, build guard, 2,814 frontend tests with one skipped, 485 Rust tests,
  coverage, and the no-bundle Tauri production build; the guarded initial bundle
  is 433 kB.

Primary invariant: known InvokeAI image assets are hidden from ordinary library
queries by default and remain directly recoverable.

Scope:

- Add a persisted `Show InvokeAI Image Assets` View control.
- Apply it consistently to gallery, collections, pinned results, statistics,
  slideshow, browser mocks, and default image queries.
- Add category badges to cards and a Source section to the viewer.
- Exclude known assets from Untagged maintenance only.
- Preserve direct viewer navigation and all other maintenance access.
- Verify the indexed query shape on a large virtualized library.

Non-goals:

- No subtype filters, dedicated asset surface, or graph navigation.

Targeted verification:

- SQL/filter/store persistence tests;
- card/viewer component tests;
- maintenance-count and query-plan regressions;
- virtualized large-library smoke coverage.

Completion criteria:

- asset visibility is consistent across normal browsing surfaces;
- unknown categories stay visible;
- assets can be revealed, inspected, and maintained without data loss.

## Work Package 4: High-Value InvokeAI Metadata Parity

Depends on: Work Package 2.

Status: Complete (`codex/invokeai-image-assets`, `2026-07-19`)

Evidence:

- the Rust parser and TypeScript mapper now agree on VAE descriptors, open
  generation-mode strings, numeric-string values, zero-preserving CFG
  precedence (`cfg_scale`, `guidance`, `cfg`), and denoising precedence
  (`denoising_strength`, `denoisingStrength`, `hrf_strength`);
- the metadata worker now reuses the shared InvokeAI mapper and preserves an
  explicit generation mode instead of replacing it with path inference;
- camelCase, snake_case, and legacy T2I adapter keys accept string, descriptor,
  and nested-model forms, normalize and deduplicate their model names, and
  enter the established control-resource taxonomy without accidental
  IP-Adapter routing;
- parser version 26 reparses existing InvokeAI records, and a native database
  regression confirms reparsed T2I resources populate `image_controlnets` but
  not `image_ipadapters`;
- 78 focused frontend mapper/worker tests and focused Rust parser, resource,
  reparse, guidance, and resource-junction tests pass;
- the complete release gate passes: version and generated-binding checks,
  lint, typecheck, build guard, 2,827 frontend tests with one skipped, 492 Rust
  tests, coverage, and the no-bundle Tauri production build; the guarded
  initial bundle is 434 kB and the metadata worker is 18.09 kB.

Primary invariant: the Rust parser, frontend mapper, and worker fallback agree
on high-value InvokeAI generation fields.

Scope:

- Add VAE extraction.
- Resolve CFG with `cfg_scale`, then `guidance`, then legacy `cfg` precedence.
- Normalize denoising strength from `denoising_strength` or `hrf_strength`.
- Accept current InvokeAI generation-mode strings without a closed TypeScript
  union silently discarding them.
- Parse camelCase and snake_case T2I adapters and route their models through the
  existing guidance/control-resource facet with a T2I subtype.
- Reuse the shared mapper in the worker and avoid path inference overwriting an
  explicit generation mode.
- Increment the shared parser version once from the branch-current value.

Non-goals:

- No broad raw-field mirroring, style-prompt UI, refiner UI, or node/session
  graph import.

Targeted verification:

- Rust, mapper, and worker parity fixtures;
- precedence and normalization boundary cases;
- reparse and resource-junction regressions.

Completion criteria:

- all three parser paths produce equivalent high-value metadata;
- established facets receive T2I adapter resources without a new top-level
  taxonomy.

## Work Package 5: Reference Extraction and Resolution

Depends on: Work Packages 1, 2, and 4.

Status: Complete (`codex/invokeai-image-assets`, `2026-07-19`)

Evidence:

- migration 64 adds a strict reference junction with the six supported roles,
  exact source-name retention, unique exact-name target resolution, and indexes
  for forward and reverse lookup;
- lifecycle triggers preserve outgoing references for Removed sources, make
  removed targets unresolved, retry on restore or later import, repair source
  and target path identities, and clean up permanent deletions;
- the InvokeAI extractor accepts canonical and supported legacy adapter keys,
  string and `{ image_name }` forms, wrapper payloads, and exact role/name
  deduplication without graph crawling or arbitrary-field inference;
- normal sync and one-time source reconciliation replace complete valid
  reference snapshots transactionally, including unchanged and Removed rows;
  malformed metadata preserves existing references;
- InvokeAI import-schema version 2 forces existing configured databases through
  reference reconciliation;
- generated bindings and their complete command/payload contract are current;
- 64 focused InvokeAI service tests, 88 sync/integration tests, 2 generated
  binding contract tests, all 2,848 frontend tests, and all 504 Rust tests pass;
- lint, typecheck, binding drift, formatting, build-size, coverage, and the
  optimized no-bundle Tauri production build checks pass.

Primary invariant: every supported reference keeps its source InvokeAI image
name even when its Ambit target cannot yet be resolved.

Scope:

- Extract `init_image`, ControlNet image/processed-image, IP-Adapter image, and
  T2I-Adapter image/processed-image references.
- Accept string and object forms containing `image_name` and deduplicate exact
  role/name pairs.
- Persist references transactionally in a junction table.
- Resolve targets by persisted InvokeAI image name after sync; retain and retry
  unresolved references.
- Keep removal and path-identity operations safe.
- Bump the InvokeAI import-schema version to reconcile existing rows.

Non-goals:

- No graph crawling, arbitrary custom-field inference, or automatic stacking.

Targeted verification:

- extraction-shape matrix;
- unresolved-then-resolved sync cases;
- removal/restoration/path-repair integrity tests.

Completion criteria:

- supported forward references survive partial libraries and later resolve
  deterministically.

## Work Package 6: Viewer Forward Links and Backlinks

Depends on: Work Package 5.

Status: Complete (`codex/invokeai-image-assets`, `2026-07-21`)

Evidence:

- a dedicated React Query read model loads forward references by the junction
  primary-key prefix and backlinks by the migration-64 target index, groups
  repeated targets, and presents the six supported roles in stable order;
- the viewer shows `Source Images` and `Used By`, keeps unresolved targets and
  Removed backlinks visible but disabled, and retries the read model after a
  target disappears during navigation;
- resolved assets outside the active query open directly in the existing
  viewer without changing the current search, collection, result list, or
  InvokeAI asset-visibility setting; Previous and Next are disabled for that
  direct view;
- directly opened assets retain normal viewer favorite, pin, removal, prompt,
  model, tool, notes, revert, and AI-recovery paths through a shared active
  image-state adapter;
- the dedicated reference query key is invalidated after every successful
  InvokeAI sync, including no-op syncs, and after removal, restoration,
  duplicate resolution, and permanent Removed deletion;
- follow-up review hardening enforces hide-mode privacy on both visible and
  off-query reference targets, and invalidates image caches after direct pins
  so cached collections restore pinned-first order;
- 207 focused tests across the viewer, App orchestration, query repository,
  sync context, and action/maintenance hooks pass with one existing skip;
- the complete release gate passes: generated-binding drift, lint, typecheck,
  build-size guard, 2,873 frontend tests with one skipped, coverage, the Rust
  test suite, and the optimized no-bundle Tauri production build.

Primary invariant: reference navigation never requires assets to be globally
visible in the gallery.

Scope:

- Show `Source Images` and `Used By` sections with role labels.
- Navigate directly to resolved images, including hidden assets.
- Display unresolved references as disabled, informative entries.
- Update backlinks incrementally as reference junctions change.

Non-goals:

- No graph visualization or reference editing.

Targeted verification:

- viewer forward/backlink component tests;
- hidden-target and unresolved-target navigation cases;
- incremental backlink query tests.

Completion criteria:

- users can traverse generation provenance in both directions without changing
  their default asset visibility.

## Work Package 7: Owner Discovery, Selection, and Reconciliation

Depends on: Work Packages 1 and 2.

Status: Complete (`codex/invokeai-image-assets`, `2026-07-22`)

Approved package boundary:

- owner candidates are owners represented by image rows; a previously selected
  owner remains recoverable when its current source count reaches zero;
- labels use display name plus stable owner ID and never read or expose email;
- selected-owner sync is gated until Work Package 8, while legacy and explicitly
  warned All users modes retain the current unscoped sync behavior.

Evidence:

- migration 65 adds durable owner facts and indexed fail-closed visibility to
  active and removed records, preserves out-of-scope rows, and invalidates
  facet, smart-collection count, and dynamic-thumbnail caches on upgrade;
- read-only discovery detects legacy and per-user schemas from the configured
  canonical database path, summarizes only owners represented by image rows,
  optionally reads `display_name`, and never queries email or authentication
  fields;
- the settings flow auto-selects a sole owner, requires an explicit choice for
  multiple owners, retains a stale saved owner with a zero count, and warns
  before enabling All users mode;
- owner changes reconcile authoritative source facts before atomically
  refreshing active and Removed visibility; path matching is separator- and
  Windows-case-safe, while generic rescans fail closed under owner scope;
- ordinary gallery, search, facet, statistics, collection, maintenance,
  thumbnail, direct-read, Removed, and reference paths consistently exclude
  owner-hidden rows, while internal reconciliation can still recover them;
- saved owner scope is bound to its canonical InvokeAI database path and clears
  the sync cursor/snapshot when changed; the WP7 gate deliberately left
  selected-owner synchronization blocked for WP8, which now enables it through
  the scope-aware contract below;
- follow-up review hardening serializes discovery and selection across root
  changes, rejects rapid competing selections, rolls native visibility back
  when persistence or the configured root changes, and commits owner settings
  only after their durable write succeeds;
- gallery/viewer state stays fail-closed while owner visibility is unsettled,
  and owner scope now covers destructive Removed actions, thumbnail and model
  caches, online model-resolution inputs, diagnostics, integrity scans, and
  native open/reveal/trash authorization;
- generated-binding drift, lint, typecheck, the production frontend build,
  2,898 frontend tests with one existing skip, 512 Rust tests with one ignored,
  98.78% statement coverage, the optimized no-bundle Tauri build, Rust
  formatting, and whitespace validation pass.

Primary invariant: changing owner scope never deletes out-of-scope Ambit rows.

Scope:

- Detect InvokeAI `user_id` support and provide a read-only owner summary using
  non-secret identifiers/display fields.
- Auto-select a sole owner; require a choice for multiple owners; provide an
  explicit warned All users mode.
- Persist source owner IDs on active and removed records.
- Reconcile existing records to owners without importing out-of-scope images.
- Mark other/unassigned rows with an indexed internal scope-hidden flag.
- Invalidate the saved cursor/snapshot and run a full scoped reconciliation
  when scope changes.

Non-goals:

- No InvokeAI authentication, password handling, shared/public-board semantics,
  or row deletion.

Targeted verification:

- legacy/no-user schema, sole-owner, multi-owner, All users, and scope-change
  matrices;
- preservation/recovery of mixed-owner and unassigned rows.

Completion criteria:

- owner choice is explicit and durable;
- out-of-scope data remains recoverable but cannot leak into ordinary results.

## Work Package 8: Scope-Aware InvokeAI Sync

Depends on: Work Package 7.

Status: Complete

Primary invariant: every InvokeAI-derived query observes the same selected
owner scope.

Scope:

- Scope images, favorites, boards, board mappings, counts, repair, startup
  catch-up, and live sync.
- Use owner boards in owner mode and preserve current behavior in All users
  mode.
- Disable orphan recovery in owner mode because filesystem-only files cannot be
  assigned safely.
- Refresh the equality-friendly indexed scope-hidden field transactionally.
- Include scope and schema version in snapshot validity.

Approved boundary and decisions:

- A sync receives one immutable `InvokeSyncScope` containing the canonical
  database path, images root, and `legacy`, `all`, or exact `owner` mode.
  Unselected multi-user state cannot create a sync scope.
- Manual, startup, and Live Watch entry points capture that same scope. Owner
  or root controls remain locked until the active Invoke sync finishes; a
  programmatic change rejects stale completion, cursor, and snapshot writes.
- Owner filtering uses parameterized `images.user_id = ?` predicates for
  candidate detection, counts, batches, path repair, favorites, and source
  reconciliation. Missing `images.user_id` fails selected-owner sync closed.
- Owner mode imports only directly owned boards and mappings through
  `boards.user_id = ?`. Missing board ownership suppresses board mapping with a
  warning while image sync continues. Shared/public board semantics remain out
  of scope.
- Migration 66 stores nullable `collections.invoke_owner_id`. Invoke collection
  listing is fail-closed against the durable owner-scope state, while all rows,
  memberships, and Ambit customizations remain stored for later scope changes.
- Orphan Recovery is operationally disabled in owner mode because filesystem
  files have no trustworthy owner. Its saved preference is preserved and
  becomes active again in All users or legacy mode.
- Invoke import snapshot schema version 3 records scope mode and owner ID, so
  Owner A, Owner B, All users, and legacy snapshots are not interchangeable.

Non-goals:

- No inference of owner for orphan files and no cross-owner sharing model.

Targeted verification:

- end-to-end scoped manual/startup/live sync tests;
- owner-board mapping and count tests;
- query-plan and large-library regressions.

Completion criteria:

- all InvokeAI sync paths enforce the selected scope consistently;
- switching scope is deterministic, recoverable, and does not duplicate or
  delete records.

Implementation evidence:

- `src/services/invoke/syncScope.ts` owns scope construction and exact owner
  predicates; `syncService.ts`, `sourceReconciliation.ts`, and `connection.ts`
  require and apply the captured scope.
- `src/contexts/SyncContext.tsx` owns admission, concurrency, stale-completion
  rejection, snapshot scope, and owner-mode orphan gating for all three sync
  modes.
- Follow-up review hardening drains Live Watch work queued behind manual or
  quiet-startup syncs, reapplies a programmatically changed scope before that
  rerun starts, and clears a cursor/snapshot that belongs to a different scope.
- `src-tauri/src/db/migrations/m66_invoke_collection_owner.rs` and the
  collection repository persist and enforce board-owner visibility without
  deleting out-of-scope data.
- Focused frontend verification covers owner/all/legacy scope contracts,
  missing ownership columns, owned boards, snapshots, collections, orphan
  gating, active-sync locking, and programmatic owner drift. The migration test
  verifies fail-closed collection visibility and indexed owner lookup.
- WP8 review gates pass: lint, TypeScript, Rust formatting, whitespace checks,
  301 focused frontend tests with one existing skip, and 25 focused Rust
  migration tests. The separate whole-workstream integration review and full
  release gate are recorded below.
- Final WP8 closure review ledger (`2026-07-22`):
  - `WP8-CR-1` (blocking, fixed): a Live Watch rerun queued during startup
    snapshot inspection could be dropped by the unchanged/missing snapshot
    early returns. All startup exits now use the same pending-rerun drain path.
  - `WP8-CR-2` (blocking, fixed): an unavailable or partial owner-board query
    could be mistaken for an authoritative empty mapping and clear untouched
    board assignments. Board results now declare whether they are authoritative;
    unavailable results preserve existing board state and never reconcile
    collections.
- Closure verification passes 309 focused frontend tests with one existing
  skip, eight focused owner-scope/migration Rust tests, lint, TypeScript, Rust
  formatting, whitespace checks, and the complete release gate.

## Workstream Integration Acceptance

Status: Complete (`2026-07-22`)

- Current `origin/main` at `b3dd6c4` was merged in `b9c4e84` without changing
  the scope or status of any numbered ComfyUI milestone.
- Migration-64 acceptance coverage in `051cb84` confirms forward reference
  lookup uses the junction primary-key prefix and backlink lookup uses
  `idx_invoke_image_references_target_image`. Existing migration-63, -65, and
  -66 regressions cover the asset-hidden and owner-scope query plans.
- The integrated review in `8871d9f` made exact-duplicate resolution reject
  owner-hidden records and preserve all InvokeAI source facts in Removed state;
  moved reference navigation onto the current gallery session; and applied the
  effective prompt-masking setting to direct reference access.
- The combined parser version is 32. This advances beyond main's independent
  version 31 so records already parsed by that version still receive the
  InvokeAI parser changes from this workstream.
- Focused acceptance passes 631 frontend tests with one existing skip across
  InvokeAI sync, mapping, snapshots, repositories, settings, maintenance,
  viewer behavior, and a bounded 10,000-image virtual grid. Seventy-two focused
  Rust migration, InvokeAI, and reparse tests pass.
- Generated-binding drift, lint, TypeScript, Rust formatting, and whitespace
  checks pass. `pnpm run verify:release` passes the guarded production build,
  3,009 frontend tests with one existing skip, 98.43% statement coverage, 556
  Rust tests with one ignored test, and the optimized no-bundle Tauri build.
- The routed user manual already covers the completed asset, source-fact,
  reference-navigation, owner-scope, and synchronization behavior. Acceptance
  used automated fixtures and query plans; no user InvokeAI database was read.

## Stage Acceptance Gates

After the work packages in each stage are review-clean:

1. Run focused Vitest coverage for InvokeAI sync/snapshot/mapper/orphan logic,
   repository mapping, search/settings, maintenance, and viewer behavior.
2. Run focused Rust migration, image-command, metadata, resource-junction, and
   reparse tests.
3. Regenerate and check Specta bindings when Rust-backed types change.
4. Run TypeScript checking, lint, `cargo fmt --check`, and `git diff --check`.
5. Run `pnpm run verify:release` as the full integration gate.
6. Exercise a large virtualized library and inspect relevant SQLite query plans.
7. Update user/manual and integration documentation for completed behavior only.

Prefer one conventional commit per work package. Stop between packages for
review; do not advertise later-stage capabilities while they remain pending.
