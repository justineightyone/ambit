# Architecture
Status: Canonical
Last reviewed: 2026-08-09

## System Overview
Ambit is a Tauri v2 desktop app with a React/TypeScript frontend and a Rust backend exposed through Tauri commands. Library assets and heavy metadata live in SQLite under Local AppData, lightweight app state lives in `library.json` under app-local data, and sensitive secrets such as the Gemini API key live in the OS keyring. Images remain the default asset type; manually imported videos use an explicit discriminator and bounded native probe.

## Major Subsystems

### Desktop Shell and Command Surface
Purpose: boot the Tauri app, register plugins, manage app-scoped state, and export Specta bindings.
Code: `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`, `src-tauri/src/main.rs`, `src/bindings.ts`
Interacts with: frontend services that call `commands.*`, Tauri plugins for SQL, filesystem, dialog, shell, and window state
Risks: command signature changes can break TypeScript callers; use `pnpm run bindings:generate` to regenerate `src/bindings.ts` and `pnpm run bindings:check` to detect drift
Related docs: `docs/progress.md#current-constraints`

### SQLite Data, Migrations, and Maintenance
Purpose: store image records, parsed metadata, facet caches, backups, reparsing state, and database maintenance behavior.
Code: `src-tauri/src/db/`
Interacts with: Rust scanner and metadata modules, TypeScript repo modules under `src/services/db/`, settings-backed folder sync
Risks: PRAGMA or migration changes affect startup, large-library performance, and data integrity
Related docs: `docs/refactor.md#persistence-boundary-cleanup`

### Metadata Extraction, Scanning, and Watcher Flows
Purpose: scan image files, extract metadata and workflows, resolve models, and watch library folders.
Code: `src-tauri/src/scanner/`, `src-tauri/src/metadata/`, `src-tauri/src/media.rs`, `src-tauri/src/watcher.rs`, `src-tauri/src/fs_commands.rs`, `src-tauri/src/security.rs`
Interacts with: frontend import, settings, maintenance, and viewer flows
Risks: parser heuristics and watcher behavior can create wrong metadata or miss library changes; external path handling must stay scoped and local
Related docs: `docs/manual/adding-folders.md`, `docs/manual/generator-integrations.md`, `docs/comfyui-support-workflow.md`

### Thumbnail Generation and Optimization
Purpose: generate cached WebP thumbnails, repair or upgrade thumbnail records in the background, expose maintenance controls, and throttle or cancel native work around foreground activity.
Code: `src-tauri/src/thumb/`, `src/services/thumbnailService.ts`, `src/hooks/useThumbnailQueue.ts`, `src/hooks/useThumbnailOps.ts`
Interacts with: SQLite image rows, app-local thumbnail storage, Activity Dock state, maintenance UI, collection thumbnail refresh, and generated Tauri bindings
Risks: background jobs write in batches and coordinate cancellation, retry backoff, cache-loss recovery, and foreground throttling; changes can create heavy disk or database work on large libraries
Related docs: `docs/manual/maintenance.md`, `docs/refactor.md#smart-thumbnail-optimization-and-thumbnail-maintenance-ownership`

Smart and Maintenance thumbnail repair share one native engine for source-root validation, generation, outcome persistence, cancellation, and diagnostics. Canonical required and upgradeable views use disjoint partial indexes and keyset ordering. Smart discovers those views incrementally without a startup count, respects failure backoff, and changes between normal and throttled orchestration around foreground activity. Maintenance keeps its exact scoped count and keyset pages, submits explicit image IDs at Fast priority, and bypasses failure backoff; Regenerate Selected additionally forces a real overwrite rather than accepting a cached file. One native job lease prevents Smart and Maintenance from processing concurrently. Manual leases carry a renderer-session owner so a replacement renderer can cancel and reclaim an abandoned operation after any active native batch settles.

The engine distinguishes three source outcomes. A readable source can be optimized or reused; an individually absent source is marked `is_missing` without deleting its cached thumbnail or database row; and a temporarily unavailable managed source root is skipped. It receives active monitored roots from the frontend, derives InvokeAI `outputs/images` roots from registered source identity, and caches unavailable roots before inspecting child files. Root probes are time-bounded, cancellation-aware, single-flight per root, and capped process-wide; a chunk containing absent children rechecks each affected root once before persistence so a drive disconnected during the run is deferred instead of marked missing. Mixed outcomes are staged and applied in one set-based transaction, with scope-cache triggers suppressed for the batch and each affected scope invalidated once. After an operation, image queries, library statistics, thumbnail facets, and collection thumbnails refresh once. Broken-reference repair, orphan cleanup, and developer-only database synchronization remain separate Maintenance tools.

Rescans preserve an active replacement thumbnail only after bounded WebP decoding validates it; missing or invalid replacements yield to the canonical thumbnail returned by the rescan.

### Frontend App Shell and Feature Surfaces
Purpose: render the desktop UI, modals, viewer, filter panel, grid/timeline/statistics views, maintenance screens, and settings flows.
Code: `src/index.tsx`, `src/App.tsx`, `src/components/`, `src/features/`
Interacts with: contexts, stores, hooks, `src/services/`, generated bindings, and Tauri plugins
Risks: `src/App.tsx` coordinates many cross-feature concerns, so changes can regress areas outside the touched feature. Gallery and Maintenance both render the shared `src/features/viewer/components/ImageViewer.tsx`, but each owns context-specific session navigation and action wiring; viewer feature changes must verify both entry points.

### Query, State, and Persistence Adapters
Purpose: own frontend query flows, transient UI state, JSON-backed settings and recent-search persistence, thumbnail services, and database helper modules.
Code: `src/contexts/`, `src/stores/`, `src/hooks/`, `src/services/`
Interacts with: `src/features/`, `src/bindings.ts`, `src-tauri/src/db/`, app-local `library.json`
Risks: state ownership is split across React Query, contexts, Zustand, and repository adapters, which makes duplicate sources of truth easy to introduce
Related docs: `docs/progress.md#current-constraints`, `docs/refactor.md#frontend-state-and-shell-coordination`

### Network Surface
Purpose: keep the core app local-first while supporting explicit public-beta network paths.
Code: `src/hooks/useAppUpdater.ts`, `src/services/geminiService.ts`, `src-tauri/src/metadata/civitai.rs`, `src/features/settings/`
Interacts with: GitHub Releases updater feed, optional Gemini API requests, optional CivitAI hash resolution, and user-clicked external support/project links
Risks: passive third-party assets or unclear copy can make local-first behavior hard to audit
Related docs: `README.md#privacy-and-network-behavior`, `SECURITY.md`

## Invariants
- SQLite is the source of truth for image records and heavy metadata. On Windows, the main library database lives in Local AppData, with Roaming AppData retained only as a legacy fallback during the public-beta transition. `library.json` should not become a second image store.
- Rust-exposed command and type changes should flow through Specta into `src/bindings.ts`; do not hand-maintain Rust-backed TypeScript mirrors.
- Generated binding updates are explicit: run `pnpm run bindings:generate`, then verify with `pnpm run bindings:check` or a broader gate that includes it.
- Filesystem access must remain local-only and within Tauri-registered or scoped paths.
- API keys are stored via Rust keyring commands, not persisted in `library.json`.
- Passive visual assets must be bundled locally. Network calls should be limited to the documented updater, Gemini, CivitAI, and user-clicked external-link paths.
- Large library browsing paths must remain virtualized and performance-conscious.
- Gallery and timeline results for videos render static posters or a generic placeholder; they must not instantiate background video players.
- The bundled MediaInfo sidecar is invoked only by Rust-owned fixed arguments against canonical picker-scoped regular files, with bounded output, timeout, cancellation, and single-process concurrency.
- Gallery and Maintenance should reuse the shared `ImageViewer` presentation instead of developing separate viewer implementations. Their navigation, deletion, recovery, and other context-dependent policies remain owned by their respective controllers.
- Removal is a recoverable database lifecycle: active images are transactionally tombstoned in `removed_images`, including their file hash and parser version, and restore reconstructs the active row plus supported memberships/resources in one transaction. Remove, restore, duplicate tombstoning, and final deletion share a process-wide coordinator so restore cannot race a source-file trash operation. Final deletion clears the tombstone only after OS-trash success (or when the source is already missing). Collection membership moves are likewise native transactions rather than frontend SQL sequences.
- Missing-source reconciliation is not deletion. It preserves the active database row and cached thumbnail so temporary storage outages are recoverable. User-requested removal is reversible and keeps its tombstone; user-requested final deletion OS-trashes the source and eligible thumbnail before clearing that tombstone.
- Full facet rebuilds populate a temporary staging table and swap into the live cache in a short transaction. Full and incremental refreshes share one coordinator so a queued targeted refresh cannot be overwritten by an older full-build snapshot.
- InvokeAI owner scope is a logical projection over one canonical Ambit database, not a separate database per user. Active images, Removed images, Invoke boards, and owner-aware Ambit collections carry an Invoke source identity; user-facing reads go through indexed scoped views driven by the atomic current-scope record. Ambit collections created in an owner view belong to that owner, collections created in `All users` are aggregate-only, and legacy unscoped collections remain shared until explicitly reassigned. Changing owners does not rewrite visibility across image rows. InvokeAI administrator status does not widen an owner projection; `All users` is the only aggregate scope. The reserved `system` owner is an ordinary owner projection, while discovery presents standard and intermediate image counts separately.
- InvokeAI board collections separate source facts from Ambit's effective projection. The source snapshot stores the authoritative board name, presence, and image names; local exclusions and additions store user organization; `collection_images` is the materialized result. Authoritative reconciliation replaces only source facts for boards present in the snapshot, follows upstream renames only when the displayed name still followed the prior source name, and retains absent boards as `Source unavailable`. Suppression hides a board collection without deleting source or override state. Reset clears local overlays and rematerializes the current source snapshot. Removed-image restore also rematerializes from current source facts and overlays, while sync refuses to resurrect tombstoned images or create active rows for missing source files.
- Facet and collection-derived caches have persistent per-scope snapshots. Mutations invalidate only scopes that can observe the changed Invoke owner (plus aggregate scopes), while local-library and global model changes invalidate every scope. A persisted dirty ledger distinguishes exact facet resources, whole facet types, collection summaries, and unknown full-rebuild causes. Dirty-ledger trigger writes use an explicit UPSERT conflict target because SQLite propagates a containing statement's conflict policy into trigger programs; shorthand `INSERT OR IGNORE` is not safe inside Ambit's image and board UPSERTs. A current snapshot activates immediately; a precisely dirty snapshot activates and repairs only its ledger entries; missing, legacy-dirty, or otherwise uncertain state falls back to a full rebuild. Cache builds use a generation handshake, so mutations during preparation prevent a partial projection from being committed as ready.
- An InvokeAI owner transition reserves synchronization until its target catch-up either succeeds or rolls back. Duplicate startup requests coalesce with the selected scope, same-scope startup callers share one active result, and Live Watch drains only after both the active run and owner transition have settled; unrelated callers cannot overwrite the selector's success decision. Enabled owner application refreshes the authoritative board catalog even for a current schema marker, so an owner-owned board remains visible with zero scoped members when all source members belong to other owners. A changed catch-up invalidates the image query; privacy-gated queries fetch after the target scope becomes ready instead of requiring a page reload. A required collection refresh that loses a normal newest-result-wins race retries until it applies a current scoped snapshot; genuine query failures still fail closed. Background Live Watch refreshes preserve the current settings and collection presentation: foreground preparation controls stay hidden, and collection summaries update without replacing established thumbnails or counts with pending placeholders.

## High-Risk Areas
- `src/App.tsx`: app shell integration point for selection, viewer, import, shortcuts, modals, and layout state.
- `src/contexts/SearchContext.tsx`: bridges React Query, SQL filter construction, collection refresh, and legacy store synchronization.
- `src-tauri/src/db/migrations/`: schema changes and backfills affect existing user libraries.
- `src-tauri/src/metadata/comfyui/`: parser heuristics are subtle and guarded by many Rust tests.
- `src-tauri/src/thumb/` and `src/hooks/useThumbnailQueue.ts`: native background work, SQLite updates, cancellation, and foreground throttling must stay coordinated.
- `src/services/TauriFsRepository.ts` and `src/stores/settingsStore.ts`: persistence behavior, settings migration, and folder scope registration.
